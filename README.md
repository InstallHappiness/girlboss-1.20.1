# Girlboss

Girlboss is a mod that lets you detect when someone sends a private message to another player and attempts to detect who the receiving player is.

The detection of someone sending a message is achieved by listening to "header packets" which are sent whenever a private message is sent.

The detection of who received it is achieved by comparing the "last message" field on the receiver's next chat message.
